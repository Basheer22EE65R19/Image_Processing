# Image Processing Techniques Showcase

This repository contains code implementations and reports showcasing various image processing techniques, including Otsu's Segmentation, Image Transformations, Histogram Equalization, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) with Bilinear Interpolation.

## Contents

- [Otsu's Segmentation](/otsu_segmentation): This directory contains the code and a report explaining the Otsu's Segmentation technique, which is used for automatic thresholding in image segmentation.

- [Image Transformations](/image_transformations): Here, you'll find the code and a report demonstrating different image transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing. These transformations alter the spatial arrangement of pixels in an image.

- [Histogram Equalization](/histogram_equalization): Explore the code and a report illustrating histogram equalization, a technique that enhances image contrast by redistributing intensity values in the histogram.

- [CLAHE with Bilinear Interpolation](/clahe_bilinear_interpolation): This section contains the code and a report showcasing Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) applied to an image using bilinear interpolation for smoother results.

## How to Use

Each technique's directory contains its own code files and a detailed report explaining the method and the results. To use the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired technique's directory.
3. Read the report for an understanding of the technique and its benefits.
4. Run the provided code using Python (make sure you have the required libraries installed).

Feel free to modify the code, experiment with different images, or adjust parameters to see how the techniques behave under various conditions.
