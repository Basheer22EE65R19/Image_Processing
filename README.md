# Image Processing Techniques Showcase

This repository contains code implementations and reports showcasing various image processing techniques, including Otsu's Segmentation, Image Transformations, Histogram Equalization, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) with Bilinear Interpolation.

## Contents

- Otsu's Segmentation: This directory contains the code and a report explaining the Otsu's Segmentation technique, which is used for automatic thresholding in image segmentation.

- Image Transformations: Here, you'll find the code and a report demonstrating different image transformations such as translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing. These transformations alter the spatial arrangement of pixels in an image.

- Histogram Equalization: Explore the code and a report illustrating histogram equalization, a technique that enhances image contrast by redistributing intensity values in the histogram.

- CLAHE with Bilinear Interpolation: This section contains the code and a report showcasing Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) applied to an image using bilinear interpolation for smoother results.
